Long-term stress is the brain's killer.
Short-term hormone secretion is protective to the body, but if it is under stress for a long time, the brain's nutrients will be reduced, leading to a decline in learning, memory, and stress control. Severely, the prefrontal cortex of the brain will shrink, and the corresponding attention, decision-making, and social power will decrease. Long-term stress will also increase the risk of senile dementia.
There are three ways to relax:
1、Meditation, fully feel your feelings of pressure, without any rejection to feel, without hostility, unreserved to observe the current feelings and thoughts, think about how it is produced, how it may develop.
2、Gratitude Letter, recall the moment of gratitude. Recall everyday things that are happy today.
3、Body massage. Relax by tapping on specific acupuncture points.
